                        The Ethiopian Society of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ESOG) was established in 1992 G.C. Its mission is to promote and enhance sexual and reproductive health (SRH) through evidence based and cohesive action of the society with active participation of its members and broad national & international partnership.</br></br></br>

                        Realizing that Ethiopia is the third populous country in Africa and among the least developed countries in the world with the background of a rapid annual population growth rate, the society recognizes that sexual and reproductive health is an issue that has a very high significance. It also recognizes the need for a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach for a significant impact in reducing maternal mortality and morbidity stemming from pregnancy related complications.</br></br></br>

                        ESOG, with an aspiration to see a society where all people in Ethiopia have the right to and enjoy full sexual and reproductive health, is committed to mobilize its members to continue to be the guiding light in sexual and reproductive health. </br></br></br>

                        The Ethiopian Society of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, to insure SRH practice for all people in Ethiopia and leading the campaign to save lives full participation of its members, is an organization which offers better hope to the Ethiopian Mothers and Children.
